3D UAV simulation show for football game day.
This is a part of the final project assignment for ECE 6122-Advanced Programming Techniques course.
It involves creating a 3D simulation of a UAV show using OpenGL with C++.

Description:
The show is made up of 15 UAVs that are placed on the football field at the 0, 25, 50, 25, 
0 yard-lines.  
The UAVs remain on the ground for 5 seconds after the beginning of the simulation.
